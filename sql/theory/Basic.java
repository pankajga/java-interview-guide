/*
 * What is Sql?
 * SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to interact with the database, 
 * i.e to create a database, to create a table in the database, to retrieve data or update a table 
 * in the database, etc. SQL is an ANSI(American National Standards Institute) standard. Using SQL, 
 * we can do many things. For example – we can execute queries, we can insert records into a table, 
 * we can update records, we can create a database, we can create a table, we can delete a table, etc.
 * 
 *  Does SQL support programming language features? 
 *  It is true that SQL is a language, but it does not support programming as it is not a programming 
 *  language, it is a command language. We do not have conditional statements in SQL like for loops or 
 *  if..else, we only have commands which we can use to query, update, delete, etc. data in the database. 
 *  SQL allows us to manipulate data in a database.
 *  
 *  Sql queries only works on Relational Databases. Relational databases are databases that stores data
 *  in table and columns
